######### DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM ##########

DNS, or the Domain Name System, acts as the internet's "phonebook," translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into the IP addresses computers use to communicate
Here's a more detailed explanation:

What it does:
DNS is a hierarchical and distributed system that maps domain names to IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using familiar names instead of numerical addresses. 

How it works:
When you type a website address into your browser, your computer first checks its local DNS cache. If the IP address isn't there, it queries a DNS server, which in turn queries other DNS servers until the IP address is found. 

Importance:
DNS is essential for the internet to function, as it makes it possible for users to navigate the web using easy-to-remember domain names. 

DNS Servers:
DNS servers are computers that store and manage DNS records, which contain the mapping of domain names to IP addresses. 

DNS Records:
These are instructions that live in authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain, including its associated IP address and how to handle requests for that domain. 

Examples:
Recursive DNS Server: The first DNS server that a client (like your computer) contacts to resolve a domain name. 
Root Name Server: The top-level DNS servers that hold information about all the top-level domains (like .com, .org, .net). 
Authoritative Name Server: The DNS server that has the definitive information about a specific domain and its subdomains. 

DNS Lookups:
The process of translating a domain name to an IP address, which is performed by DNS servers. 
Reverse DNS Lookup:
The process of determining the domain name associated with an IP address. 

DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH):
More secure protocols for DNS lookups that encrypt the communication between the client and the DNS server.

==================================================================================================================================================================================================================

### HOSTING A WEBSITE WITH DOMAIN NAME

-yum install httpd -Y

-systemctl start httpd
-systemctl enable httpd
-check the public ip in browser
-get a free css template or the website you want to host
-unzip the file (unzip XYZ.zip)
-mv to var/www/http

### HOSTED ZONES in ROUTE53
-CREATE HOSTED ZONE
-ENTER DOMAIN NAME which is purchased
-public zone create
-copy value route traffic to things which are ns-1774.awsdns-35.net/org/com to domain website such as godaddy pr hostinger (skip the last dot)
-change name servers
-paste all 4 lines (ns-1774.awsdns-35.net/org/com)
-SAVE
### MAPPING OF INSTANCE AND DOMAIN IP
-CREATE RECORD
-RECORD TYPE (A - Routes traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources)

### CNAME RECORD is used to map old website to new website name 
-VALUE (copy instance ID in the value part)
-OKAY

### BY USING LOADBALANCER

ON alias
-application and lassic load balancer
-choose region
-choose loadbalancer
